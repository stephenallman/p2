## Description
Password generator. User selects the quanity of numbers, words, and/or symbols in the password.. 
The basis is to randomly generate a more secure yet easier to remember password. 
In effect; one word is required but limited to not more than 8 words.

## Details for teaching team
Improvements can be made for user's to select whether or not they want capatilal letters. 
This was originally attempted but failed. Later I realized the failure was due to using _Post in lieu of _POST. 
So I may revist that option shortly. 
In the spirit of making passwords easier to remember, symobls and/or numbers come before or after words. 


## Outside code
No outside code but used a licensed adobe stock picture for the background.
